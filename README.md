# SimpleCraps
This is Greg's version of the simple craps game

Simple craps is a game played with a pair of dice.

On the first roll of the game, if the roll is:
- 7: winner
- 2, 3, 12: loser
Anything else becomes the “point”

Once a point is set, rolling continues until:
- The point is rolled: winner
- 7: loser

The user will be told to press any key to roll the dice
The total of the dice will be displayed
If the first roll is:
- 7 - winner; 
- 2, 3, 12 - loser; 
and the game ends

Any other number, the point is set and the user rolls again
If any subsequent roll is:
- the point - winner; 
- 7 - loser; the game ends

The user will be asked if they want to play again
- N - the program ends; 
- any other key, another game is started

## Extra Credit

Keep track of the number of games won and lost.

Programmatically run the game N number of times where N > 100 and track the won/lost
